# A few GitHub rules:
- Keep file paths short and sensible.
- Don’t use funky characters and spaces in your file names, these cause trouble because of differences in Mac/Windows systems.
-Always pull before you push in case someone has done any work since the last time you pulled - you wouldn’t want anyone’s work to get lost or to have to resolve many coding conflicts.

#My own ideas:
- add informative and clear titles/ headings and document descriptions
- agree on the items to igonore in .gitignore
- this one is to test the SSH key!/*attempt2/*attempt3
